# MeetingSeating - Scenario

The idea of the app is to highlight meeting room roomSeatData and give a fun but informative view of meeting room occupancy.

You are to create an Android application to be used to show meeting room occupation roomSeatData. A server endpoint has been created for you to retrieve roomSeatData. It is expected for this app to work offline and online. The features below are a rough guideline and you can change any you want (with discussion with your buddy) we can also create and edit the endpoints.

**Screen:**

- List of seat roomSeatData (maybe with click through to details or details on the list)
- you can filter by date or by seat or by room

**Screen:**

- List of rooms - then click through to heat map
	- "heat map" of the last day / week / month of the room. 
	 - Black - seat not used often.
	 - color spectrum inbetween
	 - White - seat is used very often.

**Screen:**

- This is all behind a Novoda login.

**Screen:**

- Debug settings screen (to toggle end points, live / mock & toggle notification timer)

***Extras:***

- Some type of notification, (a reminder to use the app if you haven't opened it for 5 days)

- Sync your calendar with the app to show overlaps of when you were in a room?
